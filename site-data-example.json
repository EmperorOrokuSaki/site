In this article, we'll explore how modern programming languages handle memory allocation and deallocation, with a focus on ownership models and borrowing rules.\n\n## Traditional Memory Management\n\nIn languages like C and C++, memory management is manual. Developers are responsible for allocating memory with `malloc` or `new` and deallocating it with `free` or `delete`. This approach offers maximum control but is prone to errors like:\n\n- Memory leaks (forgetting to free memory)\n- Use-after-free bugs\n- Double-free errors\n- Buffer overflows\n\n## Garbage Collection\n\nLanguages like Java, JavaScript, and Python use garbage collection. The runtime automatically tracks object references and frees memory when objects are no longer reachable. While this eliminates many memory-related bugs, it introduces:\n\n- Non-deterministic cleanup\n- Potential performance pauses\n- Higher memory overhead\n- Less control over resource usage\n\n## Modern Ownership Models\n\nModern systems languages have introduced ownership models that provide memory safety without garbage collection:\n\n\`\`\`rust\nfn main() {\n    // 'message' is the owner of this string\n    let message = String::from(\"Hello, world!\");\n    \n    // Ownership is moved to the function\n    print_message(message);\n    \n    // This would cause a compile error - ownership was moved\n    // println!(\"{}\", message);\n}\n\nfn print_message(msg: String) {\n    println!(\"{}\", msg);\n    // 'msg' is dropped (freed) when this function ends\n}\n\`\`\`\n\n### Borrowing Rules\n\nBorrowing allows temporary access to data without transferring ownership:\n\n\`\`\`rust\nfn main() {\n    let message = String::from(\"Hello, world!\");\n    \n    // Borrow the string (reference) - doesn't transfer ownership\n    print_message_length(&message);\n    \n    // Still valid - we still own 'message'\n    println!(\"{}\", message);\n}\n\nfn print_message_length(msg: &String) {\n    println!(\"Length: {}\", msg.len());\n    // No need to free anything - we just borrowed it\n}\n\`\`\`\n\n## Conclusion\n\nModern memory management systems provide safety without sacrificing performance. By enforcing ownership and borrowing rules at compile time, they eliminate entire categories of memory-related bugs while maintaining predictable performance characteristics."

      "content": "# Building High-Performance Web Servers with Modern Tools\n\nCreating high-performance web servers requires understanding both the underlying protocols and the tools available for implementation. This article explores modern approaches to building blazing-fast web servers.\n\n## Async I/O\n\nModern web servers leverage asynchronous I/O to handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently:\n\n\`\`\`rust\nasync fn handle_connection(mut stream: TcpStream) {\n    let mut buffer = [0; 1024];\n    stream.read(&mut buffer).await.unwrap();\n    \n    let response = \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\r\\n\\r\\nHello, World!\";\n    stream.write(response.as_bytes()).await.unwrap();\n    stream.flush().await.unwrap();\n}\n\`\`\`\n\n## Event-Driven Architecture\n\nEvent loops and non-blocking I/O allow servers to handle many connections with minimal resource usage:\n\n\`\`\`javascript\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n  res.writeHead(200);\n  res.end('Hello, World!');\n});\n\nserver.listen(8000);\nconsole.log('Server running on port 8000');\n\`\`\`\n\n## Zero-Copy Optimizations\n\nModern APIs allow data to be sent directly from disk to network without unnecessary copying:\n\n\`\`\`c\nsendfile(socket_fd, file_fd, &offset, count);\n\`\`\`\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy leveraging async I/O, event-driven architectures, and zero-copy optimizations, modern web servers can achieve remarkable performance with minimal resource usage."
