## Hello, World

Welcome to my personal site. I'm Nima, a Rust programmer and low-level compute enthusiast based in Berlin.

This site serves as a space for:

- **Technical writings** about Rust, blockchain, and systems programming
- **Philosophical musings** on software, cinema, and life
- **Project documentation** and experiments

## What I'm Working On

Currently, I'm focused on:

1. Building privacy-preserving infrastructure for Ethereum
2. Researching autonomous systems in DeFi
3. Exploring the intersection of philosophy and technology

### Technical Stack

This site is built with:

```bash
# SvelteKit + mdsvex for markdown processing
npm create svelte@latest

# Deployed as a static site to GitHub Pages
npm run build
```

Minimal dependencies, maximum control. Just how I like it.
